# Typescript Boilerplate

This is a template Typescript project.

Consider using [Volta](https://volta.sh/) for NodeJS varsion management.

## Usage

Simplest way to copy:

```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project

npx degit k-piekarczyk/typescript-boilerplate

npm install
npm run husky
```

And you're all set up :)

## Acknowledgement

This boilerplate was largely based on [this article](https://www.metachris.com/2021/04/starting-a-typescript-project-in-2021/) from [Chris Hager](https://www.metachris.com/).
